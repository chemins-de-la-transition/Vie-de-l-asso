# Access Virtual Assembly/Paths of Transition's Google Drive

New contributor ? 
First of all, welcome :)
For more transparency in the management of projects or the life of communities, the Virtual Assembly makes sure to share with its most devoted contributors all the documents related to its activities.

Thus, if you are a member of the Virtual Assembly or the Paths of Transition (or both), you can access a Google Drive as long as an active contributor authorizes you to do so. You will find there the different projects more or less related to the VA/TPOT, their circles of members, their social code (to get a better sense of the values they stand for) or their bills (if you are a little curious).

Once your access to the Google Drive of the CDLTs has been accepted, don't forget to fill in your presentation form, located in the "Contributors" folder. Simply click on the new presentation form, create a copy, fill it in, and then move it to the "completed forms" folder.
